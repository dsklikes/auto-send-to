# TSConfig

Our projects are setup to compile to as modern ESM formatted JS targetting ES2020 language features. This package centralizes our `TypeScript` related configuration to achieve this.

It provides:

- base.json, the default tsconfig to be used by projects
- `typescript` and `tsc`. Depend on `tsconfig` and not `typescript` directly so you don't have to manage its version
- `run-vitest`, a npm bin script that wraps `[vitest](https://vitest.dev/)`, a fast ESM friendly test runner.
  - note: similar to not installing `typescript` directly, you don't need to install `vitest | jest | ...`, just use this and `run-vitest`

## TypeScript Nightly

Related to dependencies, note that we're pinned to a specific nightly release of Typescript. The reason for this is that support for `moduleResolution: nodenext | node12` is gated behind nightly. This module resolution strategy lets TypeScript use package's [`exports`](https://nodejs.org/api/packages.html#subpath-exports). This allows us to use the same clean paths in development as in published packages (without moving compiled files around to the top-level).
